### Policies
Your best attendance and proactive involvement are required to maximize this course experience.  Active engagement in all course elements is the only way to make this a meaningful learning experience to improve your understanding, thinking, and future capabilities. Students are individually responsible for keeping current with course material and assignments. Grading is much less important than learning but is required and will be based on an objectives met (check), objectives exceeded (check plus), or objectives not met (check minus) system. This is logically mapped to a letter grade (no plus/minus) at the end of the semester (all checks -> B; at least some check plusses -> A; multiple check-minuses -> C or below). Non-submissions receive zero credit which significantly lowers the grade mapping, and it is in best interests to submit assignments in a timely manner. Tests or quizzes may be graded on more typical numeric scales.  This syllabus and course materials may be subject to change with reasonable notice.

### Boilerplate
